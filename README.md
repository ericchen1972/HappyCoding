# HappyCoding

The most powerful feature: 
**Trash Talk.** 
**Trash Talk.** 
**Trash Talk.**

It's so important that I said it three times. You can chat and send real-time messages with your teammates under the same Repo right within HappyCoding.
Of course, this alone isn't enough to explain HappyCoding's true advantage.

## The True Core: AI + MCP

Through MCP (Model Context Protocol), you can tell the AI:
> "Send the solution we just discussed to BoBo."

The AI will synthesize a human-readable document and send it directly. 
You no longer need to:
- Copy
- Organize
- Rewrite
- Paste it again

## Customizable Toxic (or Sweet) Modes

You can set up unique AI personas per teammate.
For example, when setting up BoBo:
> "Be a bit more toxic when talking to BoBo; he's my frenemy."

Or for Judy:
> "Be a bit sweeter/flirty when talking to Judy; she is gorgeous."

So when the AI sends the message to BoBo, it might automatically become:
> "Hey BoBo~ Stop sleeping! Open your eyes and look at the solution we just discussed."

## Cross-Border Teaming is Not a Dream

The chatroom comes with a built-in translation button.

You can:
- Translate messages with a single click.
- Or simply tell the AI:
  > "Ask Eric about the progress in Hindi."

Cross-border trash-talking, seamlessly integrated.

## Other Features

- Direct private messaging to specific targets
- Direct image pasting & uploads
- Real-time collaboration
- AI joining the fray

## Why did we build this?

Today in 2026, the amount of time we actually spend looking at code is far less than the time we spend discussing with teammates and AI. 
Yet, we don't want to leave VSCode—that is our last remaining stubbornness as engineers.

So, just use HappyCoding.
